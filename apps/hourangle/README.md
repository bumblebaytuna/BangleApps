Purpose: This app is to help align your camera star-tracker or telescope equatorial mount with the Pole Star. This stops the object you are viewing moving out of view and/or smearing in your photograph.

Background: The Pole Star (Polaris) is not in a fixed position. It rotates once around the true Galactic Pole every day. It is also very slowly moving away from the Galactic Pole.
This app mimics its slowly changing position, as it would be seen through the mount/star-tracker's polar alignment scope.

Usage: The display looks similar to a clockface but represents 24 hours rather than 12 hours (one rotation of the Pole Star around the galactic pole each day)
To represent the Pole Star very slowly moving away from the Galactic Pole, polarscopes have two rings on them, and a validity period (e.g. Year 2000 to 2030)
The outer ring represents the later date e.g. Year 2030. The inner ring represents the earlier date, e.g. Year 2000
This app works out how far the Pole Star should be between those two rings, as well as its clockface position during its daily rotation around the Galactic Pole
The actual alignment method depends on the telescope/star-tracker brand, but ultimately the aim is to get the view in the polarscope to look the same as that displayed on the app
