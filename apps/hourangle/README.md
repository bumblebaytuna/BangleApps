# Polaris Hour Angle

## Purpose
This app helps align your camera star-tracker or telescope equatorial mount with the Pole Star. Correct alignment prevents the viewed object from drifting out of view or smearing during long-exposure photographs.

## Background
The Pole Star (Polaris) is not in a fixed position. It completes one rotation around the true Galactic Pole every day and slowly moves away from the Galactic Pole over time.

This app mimics Polaris’s changing position as seen through a mount or star-tracker polar alignment scope.

## Usage
The display resembles a clock face but represents **24 hours rather than 12 hours**, corresponding to one full daily rotation of Polaris around the Galactic Pole.

Polar scopes typically include two rings and a validity period (for example, year 2000 to 2030):

- The **outer ring** represents the later date (e.g. 2030)
- The **inner ring** represents the earlier date (e.g. 2000)

The app calculates:
- How far Polaris should be positioned between these two rings
- Its correct clock-face position during the daily rotation

The exact alignment procedure depends on the telescope or star-tracker brand, but the goal is for the polar-scope view to match the display shown in the app.
